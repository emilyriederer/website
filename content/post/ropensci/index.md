Last month, I was honored to take a role on the [rOpenSci editorial board](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/10/12/editors2021/). [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/about/) provides infrastructure, process, and community to facilitate open and reproducible scientific research enabled by the sharing of reusable software. The centerpiece of their efforts is the robust [Software Peer Review](https://ropensci.org/software-review/) program which marshals a vast community of volunteer reviewers to prospective packages for onboarding to the rOpenSci ecosystem and provides a "transparent, constructive, non adversarial and open review process".

I don't recall when I first learned about rOpenSci, but I have always been hugely impressed by their efforts. On a tactical level, their drive to help facilitate the development and maintenance of reusable tools for scientists served as a role model for my thinking about development of analytical tools in industry. More holistically, their pristine process that engage and coordinate so many volunteers to make high-impact but time-boxed contributions demonstrates a managerial acumen to which I can only inspire. (And, for both these practical and philosophical aspects, there is no better resource than the excellent book [rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/).)

Upon joining the editorial team, I wrote a few words for the rOpenSci blog attempting to describe what the organization meant to me:

> I had the great fortune of stumbling upon rOpenSci relatively early in my career as an R programmer, and it's not an exaggeration to say that this organization has had one of the single largest impacts on my career. rOpenSci's meticulous documentation helped me to embrace best practices in my development work. Perhaps even more impactful is how watching rOpenSci work shaped my perspective on community building, leadership, and teamwork. I have always admired the well-oiled machine that rOpenSci has created -- sustaining massive value with limited individual overhead by clearly defining expectations, providing opinionated infrastructure, and cultivating a phenomenal community. I'm thrilled to be taking a formal role in an organization that has had such an impact on me.

In this post, I want to expand on the leadership lessons I first learned from observing rOpenSci that have deeply influenced my own definitions of what constitutes good leadership and management. Specifically, I'll explore three key areas:

-   building structures for people to succeed
-   delegating judiciously
-   knowing your value stack to avoid micromanaging
