This book explores common patterns for eleven types of data disasters encountered by entry-level data analysts, including errors related to...

**Data**

- **Data Dalliances**: Misinterpreting or misuing data based on how it was collected or what it represents 
- **Computational Quandaries**: Letting computers do what you said and not what you meant

**Analysis**

- **Egregious Aggregations**: Losing critical information when information is condensed
- **Vexing Visualization**: Confusing ourselves or others with plotting choices
- **Incredible Inferences**: Drawing incorrect conclusions for analytical results
- **Cavalier Causality**: Falling prey to spurious correlations masquerading as causality 
- **Mindless Modeling**: Failing to get the most value out of models by not tailoring the features, targets, and performance metrics 
- **Alternative Algorithms**: Lacking an understanding of alternative methods which may be better suited for the problem at hand

**Workflow**

- **Futile Findings**: Asking and answering questions that aren't useful
- **Complexifying Code**: Making projects unwieldy or more difficult to understand than necessary
- **Rejecting Reproducibility**: Working inefficiently instead of an efficient, reproducible, and sharable workflow
