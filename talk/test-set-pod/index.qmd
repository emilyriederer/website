## Episode Notes

Emily’s had a wild ride through modeling, data engineering, machine learning, and back again, and she knows a thing or three about the evolution of SQL tooling (from nightmare multi-page scripts to the dbt renaissance). She reveals how building internal packages became her gateway to making work enjoyable. Plus: the surprising Stata origins of column selectors, the eternal struggle of naming packages across R and Python, and why watching people code teaches you more than any tutorial ever could. The conversation gets real about imposter syndrome and the magic of tacit knowledge.
